# Discord.js Bot Example
Bluefox Example: Bot with argument parsing and multiple commands

## Setup

Open the .env file and write your token in the appropriate location after the =
Do the same for your User ID and the bot's desired prefix.

Note that env files are not json or js files, do not put quotes or space anywhere.
The equal sign defines the variable's value, so `PREFIX=+` , is like `const PREFIX = "+";`

It should look like: 

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=MTg-this-IzNzU3OTA5NjA-is.not-DCeFB-a.real-r4DQlO-t0ken-qerT0
OWNER=139412744439988224
PREFIX=+
```

Save the file, and start your app, and it should login.
